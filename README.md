🕵️‍♂️ Payment Fraud Detection using GenAI + Local LLM
A cutting-edge fraud detection system that integrates Local LLMs (via Ollama), Vector Databases, and Java-based transaction processing to identify suspicious payment activity in real time.

🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional fraud detection systems struggle with adaptability and context-awareness. This project leverages GenAI to enhance fraud detection by:
• 	Understanding transaction patterns semantically
• 	Matching user behavior against historical embeddings
• 	Providing explainable AI-driven alerts

Key components:
- Ollama Local LLM: Processes transaction narratives and flags anomalies
- Vector DB: Stores embeddings of historical transactions
- Java Backend: Handles real-time transaction flow and API endpoints

⚙️ Setup Instructions
- Install Ollama and load your preferred LLM (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA2)
- Set up Vector DB (e.g., Chroma or Pinecone)
- Run Java backend to simulate transactions
- Connect LLM to Vector DB for semantic matching
